# Gesture-Controlled-Arm-With-Arduino-and-Python
A gesture-controlled robotic arm uses an Arduino and Webcam to detect hand movements. Python processes these gestures and sends commands to the Arduino. The Arduino then controls the robotic arm's motors to mimic the gestures, enabling intuitive and precise control.
